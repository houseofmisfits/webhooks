Then it's important to explain what has happened and why you're reaching out. It's also important you specify with detail everything, including screenshots and everything. Do not try to make it short, try to make it good.\nExample:\n'Hello! Im a mod from the HoM server, im reaching out to you because we have seen you posted an offensive meme in #shitposts. This falls into rule 86 (which states turtles are cool and you can't say otherwise) as it contains a slur and promotes hate against turtles [provides screenshots]. \nFor now we have deleted the meme and issued a warning." }]
