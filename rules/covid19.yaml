  - When's the last time you washed your hands?
  - Sanitize your surfaces!
  - Cover your coughs and sneezes, if not with a tissue, then with your elbow.
  - If you have to leave the house, at least where a mask or face covering of some kind. You can find out more about cloth face coverings on the CDC website. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html
  - Remember to stay 6 feet away! If a tall person can't lay down between you and another person, you are too close.

  - Staying in? Make sure you stretch!
  - Make sure you spend time doing things you enjoy!
  - With everything so crazy right now, it's a good time to disconnect, meditate, and unwind. Take care of yourselves.
  - There are a lot of rumors about the pandemic, and not all of them are true. To avoid panic, make sure you use reputable sources, like the CDC.
  - "How are y'all doing at home? If you are feeling a mix of emotions from being cooped up, you can let off some steam in <\\#711784673474248734>."
  - I know we're all stuck at home, but try to come up with a daily routine. It can help these times feel a little less chaotic.
  - Stay connected to your friends! I'm sure they will appreciate you reaching out to them.
  - Have you checked your water intake today? Hydration is important to keep you from getting sick.
