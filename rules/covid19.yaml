  - "How are y'all doing at home? If you are feeling a mix of emotions from being cooped up, you can let off some steam in <#644378741232893952>."
  - I know we're all stuck at home, but try to come up with a daily routine. It can help these times feel a little less chaotic.
  - Stay connected to your friends! I'm sure they will appreciate you reaching out to them.
